# Disclaimer

This project was an assignment given by the Erasmus university college Brussels, for the IOS development course given by Johan Van Den Broek. The computer used while building this app is from Huei Li Yap. This is the reason why you will see her name mentioned in the comments of files. (auto-generated by xcode) She did not work on this project but I would like to thank her for lending me her laptop.
